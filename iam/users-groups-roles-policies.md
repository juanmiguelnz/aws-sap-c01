### IAM Roles and Cross-account Access

#### Trusted Account vs Trusting Account
* Trusted Account - This is where the users are created. A Policy with the ARN of the IAM Role (from the Trusting Account) is created and assigned to the user or group.
* Trusting Account - This is where IAM roles are created that can be "assumed" by the users from the Trusted Accoount to be able to create resources.
