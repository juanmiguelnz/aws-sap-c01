## Database-as-a-Service

## Standby
* Synchronous

## Backups

## Read Replica
* Asynchronous
* Can be promoted as a new read-write database instance when the primary is unavailable resulting to low RTO
* Malwares, data corruction, etc. are replicated; Backups or snapshots must be used to recover in this scenario
